## Authentication Flow

The app uses AsyncStorage for persistent authentication:

2. **Login/Register**: Validates credentials and stores user data
3. **Session Management**: Maintains user session across app restarts
4. **Logout**: Clears all stored data and returns to login

## Styling

The app uses a consistent design system:
- **Primary Color**: #4A90E2 (Blue)
- **Background**: #f8f9fa (Light Gray)
- **Text Colors**: #333 (Dark), #666 (Medium), #999 (Light)
- **Border Radius**: 12px for cards, 8px for buttons
- **Shadows**: Subtle elevation for depth

## Next Steps

1. **Implement React Navigation** for proper screen transitions
2. **Add Service Booking Flow** with service selection and scheduling
3. **Integrate Real Backend** for actual authentication and data
4. **Add Push Notifications** for booking updates
5. **Implement Payment Gateway** for service payments

## Backend API (Coming Soon)

A backend will be scaffolded in a new `backend/` directory using FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication. It will provide endpoints and models matching all features in `src/mockData.json` (users, addresses, services, service details, etc.).

Setup and usage instructions will be included once the backend is scaffolded.
